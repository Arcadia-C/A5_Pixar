        <h1>Are Pixar Films Getting Worse?</h1>
        <p>Not so long ago (in 1994 to be exact), on a hot day in California, there were four men having lunch at a frequented spot: The Hidden City Cafe.</p>
        <p>But this was no ordinary lunch. And these were no ordinary people. They were Pixar's directors and were brainstorming new ideas for their next movies.</p>
        <p>Given that they were wrapping up production on Toy Story (which would release the following year), they were filled with stories they wanted to tell.</p>
        <p>From the small-scaled story of a Bug's Life to the gigantic tale of Monster's Inc, several narratives were spun in the fabled "$2 Billion Lunch Meeting".</p>
        <p>The last idea they came up with was WALL-E which would release in 2008.</p>

        <p>But is it just Pixar films that are "getting worse" or cinema as a whole?</p>
