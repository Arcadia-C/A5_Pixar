        <h1>Are Pixar Films Getting Worse?</h1>
        <p>Not so long ago (in 1994 to be exact), on a hot day in California, there were four men having lunch at a frequented spot: The Hidden City Cafe. 
            But this was no ordinary lunch. And they were no ordinary people. 
            They were Pixar's directors and were brainstorming new ideas for their next movies. 
            Given that they were wrapping up production on Toy Story (which would release the following year), they were buzzing with ideas of what to do next. 
            From the small-scaled story of a Bug's Life to the gigantic tale of Monster's Inc, several narratives were born in the fabled "$2 Billion Lunch Meeting".</p>
        <p>The last idea they came up with was WALL-E, which would release in 2008.</p>

                width="700"

            </iframe>
        </div>

        <p>But there's a problem when it comes to this teaser trailer: doesn't it seem like everything after WALL-E was an afterthought?</p>
        <p>Thus, one way to divide the Pixar timeline are "pre-WALL-E" films and "post-WALL-E" films (with the dividing line being at 2008). 
            Many people believe that all the "pre-WALL-E" films are the greatest of Pixar's work, whereas those after it were... well an afterthought (except for maybe the first 15 minutes of Up).
        </p>
        <p>But are they right? Is there a way to tell if there is a decline in Pixar films after 2008? Or more generally...</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Are Pixar Films Getting Worse?</h3>
        <p>To see if this is the case, we first need some metrics for measuring the "quality" of Pixar film. We have devised the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Originality</li>
            <li>2. Box Office Returns</li>
            <li>3. Audience Reception</li>
            <li>4. Critical Acclaim</li>
            <li>5. Artists Involved In The Movies</li>
          </ul> 
        <p>And at the very end, we'll let YOU decide which of these factors are important!</p>
        <p>But before we get into the Pixar movie metrics, we have another question to address:</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Is it just Pixar films that are "getting worse" or cinema as a whole?</h3>
        <p>We could conclude that Pixar films are getting worse, but that doesn't mean much if the general state of cinema is in decline.
            To mitigate this, some of our metrics will have comparison "baselines" to illustrate what the "standard" value of the metric was at the time.
        </p>
        <p>For instance, consider "audience reception". It may be the case that Pixar reviews are going down, but we're also going to compare it against other movies
            around the same time to see if they are relatively "worse" than other movies at the time. This will be displayed visually in the visualizations as "baseline"
            datapoints.
