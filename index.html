      <p>
        Not so long ago (in 1994 to be exact), on a hot day in California, there
        were four men having lunch at a frequented spot: The Hidden City Cafe.
        But this was no ordinary lunch. And they were no ordinary people. They
        were Pixar's directors and were brainstorming new ideas for their next
        movies. Given that they were wrapping up production on Toy Story (which
        would release the following year), they were buzzing with ideas of what
        to do next. From the small-scaled story of a Bug's Life to the gigantic
        tale of Monster's Inc, several narratives were born in the fabled "$2
        Billion Lunch Meeting".
      </p>
      <p>
        The last idea they came up with was WALL-E, which would release in 2008.
      </p>

      <div class="video-container">
        <iframe
          width="700"
          height="1700"
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggV082dBgcY"
          frameborder="0"
          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
          allowfullscreen
        >
        </iframe>
      </div>

      <p>
        But there's a problem when it comes to this teaser trailer: doesn't it
        seem like everything after WALL-E was an afterthought?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, one way to divide the Pixar timeline are "pre-WALL-E" films and
        "post-WALL-E" films (with the dividing line being at 2008). Many people
        believe that all the "pre-WALL-E" films are the greatest of Pixar's
        work, whereas those after it were... well an afterthought (except for
        maybe the first 15 minutes of Up).
      </p>
      <p>
        But are they right? Is there a way to tell if there is a decline in
        Pixar films after 2008? Or more generally...
      </p>
      <h3>Has perception of Pixar films gotten worse?</h3>
      <p>
        To see if this is the case, we will dive into several metrics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Originality</li>
        <li>2. Box Office Returns</li>
        <li>3. Audience Reception</li>
        <li>4. Critical Acclaim</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And at the very end, we'll let YOU decide which of these factors are
        important!
      </p>
      <p>
        But before we get into the Pixar movie metrics, we have another question
        to address:
      </p>
      <h3>Is Pixar's perceived decline unique, or part of broader industry trends?</h3>
      <p>
        We could conclude that Pixar films are getting worse, but that doesn't
        mean much if the general state of cinema is in decline. To mitigate
        this, some of our metrics will have comparison "baselines" to illustrate
        what the "standard" value of the metric was at the time.

          <h2>The Financial Evolution</h2>
          <p>The data reveals a stark financial pattern: Pixar's box office performance peaked with sequels like Incredibles 2 and Finding Dory, while original films have shown more modest returns. This commercial pressure may be influencing creative decisions, pushing the studio toward safer, franchise-based projects.</p>

          <p>After 2010, a clear shift emerged: sequels multiplied while original stories became increasingly rare. This transformation raises fundamental questions about the balance between creative risk-taking and commercial certainty. Has Pixar's acquisition by Disney accelerated this trend toward franchise expansion?</p>

      <h3>You Decide: What Makes a Great Pixar Movie?</h3>
      <p>
        This interactive chart invites you to define what you believe makes a Pixar movie truly magical.
        Using a set of customizable sliders, you can assign importance to different factors like 
        box office success, critical reception, originality, and awards recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each film is assigned a <strong>Magic Score</strong> based on your personal weighting of these metrics:
        <ul style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; padding-left: 20px;">
          <li><strong>Box Office Performance</strong> â€” total worldwide gross sales</li>
          <li><strong>Opening Weekend</strong> â€” early momentum and excitement</li>
          <li><strong>Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, Metacritic Ratings</strong> â€” ratings across three major players</li>
          <li><strong>Originality</strong> â€” whether the film is an original story or a sequel</li>
          <li><strong>Awards Recognition</strong> â€” number and prestige of awards</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Magic Score</strong> is dynamically recalculated as you adjust the sliders, letting you explore 
        how different priorities (like critical acclaim vs originality) affect which movies rise to the top.

      <h1>Pixar Visualization Writeup</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This project explores the evolution of Pixar films over time, examining whether there has been a decline in their quality, popularity, or cultural impact. 
        The motivation for this study is the widespread perception that Pixar's early films were superior to their more recent releases. 
        We aim to explore this perception by visualizing key metrics of Pixar movies, such as box office revenue, audience reception, critical acclaim, and originality, 
        and providing users with an interactive interface to draw their own conclusions.</p>

      <h2>Related Work</h2>
      <p>Prior studies on film industry trends have focused on various factors like box office earnings, critical ratings, 
        and audience reviews to analyze the performance and impact of movies over time. Existing visualizations of 
        movie data often use static charts, but our approach adds a dynamic, user-interactive element that allows 
        users to explore individual movies and their associated metrics in greater detail.</p>

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>We used a dataset of Pixar movies compiled from publicly available sources, including Box Office Mojo, Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDb. 
        The dataset includes attributes such as movie title, release year, director, worldwide gross revenue, critic and audience scores, 
        MPAA rating, and a link to each movieâ€™s trailer on YouTube. After collecting the data, we cleaned it using Python and manual validation,
        standardizing monetary values to USD and converting scores to a uniform 0â€“100 scale. Categorical variables like genre and director 
        were normalized to ensure consistency in the display.

        In D3.js, we loaded the dataset as a CSV and used JavaScript functions to parse and structure the data for rendering. We also included 
        derived fields, such as inflation-adjusted revenue. These allowed us to group and filter data more effectively, enabling richer 
        visual exploration. We experimented with different types of visual encodingsâ€”such as scatterplots and line chartsâ€”but ultimately chose a vertical bar 
        chart for its simplicity and clarity. 
        </p>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>We chose a bar chart because it effectively communicates the comparative performance of movies over time. 
        We added interaction features, allowing users to click on a bar to see detailed information about the selected movie, 
        including a trailer video, director, genre, and critical ratings. This design enhances user engagement and 
        provides contextual insights.</p>

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>The project was implemented using D3.js (version 7), with support from auxiliary libraries like d3-tip for tooltips and 
        d3-transition for animation control. The visualization structure was built using standard HTML and styled with modular CSS 
        to keep the layout responsive. For mobile compatibility and accessibility, we also ensured the chart resized dynamically 
        with viewport changes.

        To make interactions seamless, we used D3â€™s enter-update-exit pattern, enabling smooth animations as users interacted with 
        elements. Each bar in the chart is clickable, triggering a transition to expand and reveal metadata about the movie, including 
        an embedded trailer using an iframe. We cached video URLs and precomputed movie metrics to avoid runtime lookups and delays.
        
        Performance tuning was essential, particularly for animations and resizing. We minimized DOM manipulation by reusing elements 
        wherever possible and avoided re-rendering unchanged components. Event delegation was applied at the SVG container level to 
        reduce the overhead of attaching listeners to each individual bar. Additionally, lazy loading was used for trailer videos to 
        prevent unnecessary iframe overhead during initial page load.</p>

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>The final visualization succeeds in offering both high-level trends and detailed per-movie information in an accessible interface. 
        The bar chart allows users to quickly scan for outliersâ€”such as major box office hits like Incredibles 2 or underperformers like 
        Onwardâ€”while the expandable view provides depth without overwhelming the initial layout. Users appreciated the compactness of the 
        design and the immediate payoff when clicking on a movie.

        Some challenges were observed in initial user testing. A few participants were unsure how to interact with the chart until prompted, 
        particularly when it came to expanding a bar. This suggests that clearer affordances, like hover hints or onboarding instructions, could 
        improve first-time user experience. Additionally, there was some interest in adding sorting or filtering options, especially by rating 
        or director.
        
        Despite these minor usability issues, users consistently reported that the visualization helped them understand Pixarâ€™s trajectory 
        over time. It sparked reflection on how the studio's creative direction may have shifted and which metricsâ€”such as originality or 
        critical acclaimâ€”might carry more weight in evaluating artistic success.</p>

      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      <p>We plan to enhance the visualization by adding user-adjustable weighting for different metrics (box office, 
        critical ratings, originality, etc.), allowing users to explore different interpretations of movie quality. 
        Additionally, incorporating comparison data for other animation studios, such as DreamWorks, could provide 
        broader industry context.

        Another planned enhancement is the addition of filtering and sorting capabilities. In a later version, users choose 
        to view only films within a certain revenue bracket, time period, or directorial era, which would improve the exploratory 
        potential of the interface. A timeline view or animation that illustrates how Pixarâ€™s output evolved chronologically 
        is also under consideration, as it would add temporal clarity to user insights.
      </p>

      <p>This project was built using D3.js and JavaScript. The data was sourced from the Pixar movie dataset, 
        and additional support was provided through guidance and feedback from peers.</p>
